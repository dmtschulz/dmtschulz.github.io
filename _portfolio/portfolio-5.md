### 2 NLP Projects

<u>Description of 1st Project</u>: <br/>
This project focuses on oppositional thinking analysis through text classification. Using a dataset of 4,000 email instances, the goal was to distinguish critical discourse from conspiratorial narratives. Key tasks included extracting data insights, selecting appropriate pre-processing techniques, and applying Naïve Bayes and Neural Network models for text classification. Additionally, semantic textual similarity was computed to enhance understanding of discourse patterns. The results highlight the effectiveness of these methods in classifying and analyzing narratives, providing valuable insights into misinformation detection and the distinction between critical and conspiratorial content.

**Key Highlights:**
- **Models / Neural Network Architecture Constructed**: Naïve Bayes, Feedforward Neural Network
- **Tools**: PyTorch, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Jupyter Notebook

<u>Description of 2nd Project</u>:<br/>
This project involves developing a machine translation model to automatically translate text between English and German and Vice Versa. The project leverages deep neural networks, which have greatly improved translation performance and accuracy in recent years.

**Key Highlights:**
- **Models / Neural Network Architecture**: RNN based sequence to sequence models (encoder-decoder), Attention Mechanism, GloVe, Word2Vec
- **Tools**: PyTorch, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Jupyter Notebook

<i>Note</i>: No performance scores are provided as the objective was to construct the models. Achieving higher accuracy would require additional computational resources.

These projects were part of my university module.
