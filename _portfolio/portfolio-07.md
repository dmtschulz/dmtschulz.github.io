### FashionMNIST Regularization

This project explores how regularization techniques like early stopping and dropout help prevent overfitting when training a simple feedforward neural network on a deliberately small subset of the FashionMNIST dataset.

**Key Highlights:**
- **Model Used**: Feedforward Neural Network (2 hidden layers)
- **Techniques**: Early Stopping, Dropout (p=0.16)
- **Test Accuracy**: ~0.7532
- **Tools**: PyTorch, Torchvision, Matplotlib, Jupyter Notebook
