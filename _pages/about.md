I am currently pursuing a M.Sc. degree in Computer Science at [Technische Universität Berlin](https://www.tu.berlin/), with a strong passion for machine learning and its applications. My academic journey has equipped me with solid skills in software development and data analysis, and I am eager to apply this knowledge to real-world projects.

I wrote my bachelor’s thesis on the topic “[Vision-based Pose Estimation of a Non-Cooperative Tumbling Object using Machine Learning](/files/b_thesis.pdf)([example](./images/uni/astrobee.png))”. This project deepened my understanding of machine learning techniques and their practical applications in challenging scenarios.

I am highly motivated to contribute to projects in the fields of machine learning and data science, and I continuously seek opportunities to expand my expertise and collaborate on innovative solutions.
